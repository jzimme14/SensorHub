1. Build Database to store the received data
2. Write html file which showes the data from the database in a convenient manner
3. Give the Server a static IP-adress
4. Give the Server a local Hostname that is put into the routers DNS-Server list (example: butzdigga == 192.168.1.119:8080)
5. Build the Transponder Board with the Lolin32 and the BME280 and make it send its data once every hour. While not sending, go to deepsleep-mode.

6. (maybe) add a wakeup-controller to the lolin32 which starts the mcu only if it receives a specific signal




todos:
1. make index.html file the only file and write function that changes the headerline when clicking on item in sidebar.
plus: send get request to server when other data is needed and make the server respond to this with the respective data.
